Once installed, you can access the different parts of react-darkroom as follows:

```js import { Darkroom, Canvas, History, Toolbar, FilePicker, CropMenu } from 'react-darkroom';```

react-darkroom was built using composition, so it can be modified more easily.  However this increases the amount of steps
necessary to render the component.
